   THE DIVINE ARCHIVES — The Vault (manuscripts, relics & contested objects)
   Registry for the Vault section. tools/build-vault.js reads this file and the
   markdown in /vault/ to bake docs/vault.html and docs/vault/<slug>.html.

   Each published item may carry a `study` block for the image study viewer:
     manifest   — a IIIF Presentation (v2 or v3) manifest URL, loaded live in the
                  reader's browser from the holding institution (never copied here)
     rights     — plain statement of who owns the images and on what terms
     external   — official viewers to link out to when images can't be embedded
     transcription — optional machine-readable text source for the text panel
   Queued items are listed on the Vault index as "in preparation" and get no
   page until their entry is written to the sourcing standard.
